42 Inception
This project consists in having you set up a small infrastructure composed of different services under specific rules. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. You have to use docker-compose.

Warning: Don't copy/paste anything you don't understand: it's bad for you, and for the school.

 About the project
Mandatory part
Each Docker image must have the same name as its corresponding service. Each service has to run in a dedicated container: You then have to set up:

A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and configured) only without nginx.
A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.
A volume that contains your WordPress database.
A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.
Your containers have to restart in case of a crash.
Here is an example diagram of the expected result:

Bonus part
For this project, the bonus part is aimed to be simple. A Dockerfile must be written for each extra service. Thus, each one of them will run inside its own container and will have, if necessary, its dedicated volume.

Bonus list:

Set up redis cache for your WordPress website in order to properly manage the cache.
Set up a FTP server container pointing to the volume of your WordPress website.
Create a simple static website in the language of your choice except PHP (Yes, PHP is excluded!). For example, a showcase site or a site for presenting your resume.
Set up Adminer.
Set up a service of your choice that you think is useful. During the defense, you will have to justify your choice.
⚙️ Start Containers
You can run:

make in the root of the directory to build and start all container

make build to build all images in docker-compose

make up to start all containers in docker-compose

make down to remove all containers in the docker-compose

make start to start all containers in the docker-compose

make stop to stop all containers in the docker-compose

make status to see the running containers

make logs to see the logs of the containers

make rmi NOTE This command will remove ALL IMAGES CREATED BY DOCKER-COMPOSE.

make re to remove, build and run all containers in docker-compose
